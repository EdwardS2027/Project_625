# Abstract
COVID-19 is a global pandemic with mortality rates comparable to those of other major diseases, calling for a need for effective prevention and treatment strategies. We used the dataset collected by Center for Disease Control (CDC) to study COVID-19, and several factors in this dataset such as states, age groups, or co-existing conditions were analyzed. To analyze this dataset, a time series plot was created for purposes of temporal and condition group differences and a spatial mapping of COVID-19 deaths over states was created. Given the non-linear temporal and spatial trends discovered in the initial analysis of the dataset, a generalized linear model was used to model the COVID-19 deaths from the factors in the dataset.
